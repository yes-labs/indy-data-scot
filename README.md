# IndyData.Scot

## What is this repo?

Code for downloading and transforming data.

## The goal

Data that's relevant to the campaign Scottish Independence should be easy to access and 
easy to analyse for everyone.

## Values

1. We'll only access data from authoritative, public sources.
2. The process by which we arrive at processed data should be transparent and repeatable (i.e. 
scripted).
3. There must always be a clear source attribution.
